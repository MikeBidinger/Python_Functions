# Python Functions - [api_functions.py](api_functions.py)

Standardized API functions to save up repetitive work and keep code clean within Python scripting.
These all have basic formats and uses, but they can be customized relatively easily to achieve tailored functionalities.

## [main.py](main.py)

> [!NOTE]
> This script uses the module [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).
> These modules are not build-in with Python.

This python script contains a Streamlit application where the API GET request can be made.
Here the URL and the parameters for the API request can be entered.

To run the application use the following commands:

1.  Be sure to be located in the correct directory:

```bash
cd path/to/directory
```

2.  Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
